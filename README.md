**_Timeline of the evolution of life on Earth_**

#Project idea:
Interactive timeline where you can feel and see how much time passed between the different periods of time during the evolution of life on Earth. We are not showing the time on the usuall way we find it on "regular" timelines which mention how many years ago something happened, we are showing the amount of years passing by since the Earth was formed so it is possible to have another perspective of the passing of time. We also added some usefull information to guide you through the process and to show you some interesting information about the evolution of life. To use the timeline is needed to move the mouse or cursor on repetitive movements from one side to another to make the years pass and pressing the mouse at any part of the screen shows what happen in each period of time.

#Challenges:
It was hard to come up with an idea out of scale for this topic because of the amount of information that is involved on it. We needed to search through a lot of information to be sure in which way we shoudl show it and summerized it. Inicially we wanted to do a scrolling timeline but it was to complicated for us to make the changes of the screen. We were also searching for some codes that could help us improve our project, but at the end we decided to use them only as a reference and write our own.
